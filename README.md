# Temple University Doctoral Dissertation Template 2024

Since Temple University Graduate School only provides LaTeX templates that are more than 10 years old, I created an updated version based on the 2024 [Dissertation and Thesis 
   Handbook](https://grad.temple.edu/resources/dissertation-thesis-handbook).
A complete dissertation template demonstration can be viewed in my doctoral dissertation: [Robot Navigation in Crowded Dynamic Scenes](https://scholarshare.temple.edu/bitstream/handle/20.500.12613/10624/Xie_temple_0225E_15813.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y).


Note that this overleaf template is modified from the previous templates contributed by: [Dr. Shuimei Zhang](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RdDiYAkyu8HghaO46KsOoKSn0CzqkS6r/view?usp=sharing) and 
[Dr. Whitney Armstrong](https://github.com/whit2333/tuthesis).
Special thanks to them.
